# Face Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project uses deep learning to recognize emotions from facial expressions in images. We utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images into emotional categories such as "Happy," "Sad," "Angry," and others.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the FER-2013 dataset, which consists of labeled images of facial expressions. You can download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deadskull7/fer2013).

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Understanding and Preprocessing
- Load and explore the dataset to understand the structure.
- Preprocess the images by resizing, normalizing, and performing data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip).
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

### 2. Model Construction
- Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using layers such as convolution, max-pooling, and dropout.
- Use softmax activation in the output layer for multi-class classification.
- Compile the model using categorical_crossentropy loss function and accuracy metric.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation
- Train the model on the training data, using the validation data for tuning.
- Implement EarlyStopping to avoid overfitting.
- Plot training and validation loss/accuracy curves to monitor progress.

### 4. Model Optimization
- Experiment with different CNN architectures to improve performance.
- Tune hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and epochs.
- Apply techniques like data augmentation and dropout for better generalization.

### 5. Face Emotion Prediction
- Load the trained model and predict emotions on new images.
- Preprocess the input images, then classify and visualize the predicted emotion.

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Generate a confusion matrix to assess model performance.
- Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score for each emotion class.
- Analyze misclassified emotions and suggest improvements.
